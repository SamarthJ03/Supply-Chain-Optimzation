# Supply-Chain-Optimzation
**Business Problem**: 
A FMCG company has entered into the instant noodles business two years back. Their higher 
management has notices that there is a miss match in the demand and supply. Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low and where the demand is low, supply is pretty high. In both the ways it is an inventory cost loss to the company; hence, the higher management wants to optimize the supply quantity in each and every warehouse in entire country. 
**Goal & Objective** : The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data that will 
determine an optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time to the warehouse
